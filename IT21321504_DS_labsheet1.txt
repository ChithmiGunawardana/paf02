(a) For each client, get the client’s name, and the list of the client’s investments with stock name, 
current price, last dividend and earnings per share. 

SELECT distinct c.name AS client_name,
       s.company AS stock_name,
       s.price AS current_price,
       s.dividend AS last_dividend,
       s.eps AS earnings_per_share
FROM client c
JOIN purchase p ON c.clno = p.clno
JOIN stock s ON p.company = s.company;


(b) Get the list of all clients and their share investments, showing the client name, and for each 
stock held by the client, the name of the stock, total number of shares held, and the average 
purchase price paid by the client for the stock. Average price is the total purchase value paid 
by a client for a given stock (value=qty*price) divided by the total quantity held by the client.

SELECT c.name AS client_name, p.company AS stock_name, SUM(p.qty) As total_shares_held, SUM(qty*price)/SUM(p.qty) AS Avarage_purchase_price
FROM client c 
JOIN purchase p ON c.clno = p.clno
GROUP BY c.name, p.company;


(c) For each stock traded in New York, find the quantity held by each client, and its current value 
(value=qty*price). Display stock (company) name, client name, number of shares held, and 
the current value of the shares.

SELECT c.name AS client_name, s.company AS stock_name, SUM(p.qty) AS total_shares_held, SUM(p.qty*s.price) AS current_value_of_shares
From client c
JOIN purchase p ON c.clno = p.clno
JOIN stock s ON p.company = s.company
JOIN trading t ON s.company = t.company
WHERE t.exchange = 'New York'
GROUP BY c.name, s.company;


(d) Find the total purchase value of investments for all clients. Display client name and total 
purchase value of the client’s portfolio. 

SELECT c.name AS client_name,SUM(p.qty*p.price)AS total_purchase_value
FROM client c
JOIN purchase p ON c.clno = p.clno
GROUP BY c.name;


(e) For each client, list the book profit (or loss) on the total share investment. Book profit is the 
total value of all stocks based on the current prices less the total amount paid for purchasing 
them.

SELECT c.name AS client_name,SUM(p.qty*(s.price-p.price)) AS Book_profit
FROM client c
JOIN purchase p ON c.clno = p.clno
JOIN stock s ON p.company = s.company
GROUP BY c.name;
